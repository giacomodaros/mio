And I think, as we look towards the next fifty to one hundred years, if we really can come up with these machines that can capture an underlying spirit, or an underlying set of principles, or an underlying way of looking at the world, then, when the next Aristotle comes around, maybe if he carries around one of these machines with him his whole life—his or her whole life—and types in all this stuff, then maybe someday, after this person’s dead and gone, we can ask this machine, “Hey, what would Aristotle have said? What about this?” And maybe we won’t get the right answer, but maybe we will.

That’s what we want to do. And we want to do it this decade. And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything—you’re
Evidenziazione (giallo) - Speech at the International Design Conference in Aspen &gt; Posizione 349</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>And what I mean by that is, most of us didn’t make the clothes we’re wearing, and we didn’t cook or grow the food that we eat, and we’re speaking a language that was developed by other people, and we use a mathematics that was developed by other people. We are constantly taking. And the ability to put something back into the pool of human experience is extremely neat.

Evidenziazione (giallo) - Speech at Palo Alto High School &gt; Posizione 906</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>First and foremost is the notion that your work is different and separate from the rest of your life. If you are passionate about your life and your work, this can’t be so.
Evidenziazione (giallo) - Speech at Palo Alto High School &gt; Posizione 924</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>I still regret not kissing Nancy Kinniman in high school. Who knows what might have happened? Maybe she regrets it too …

Evidenziazione (giallo) - Drafting the Stanford Commencement Address &gt; Posizione 1936</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>“If this was the last day of my life, would I rather have dinner with the important customers or her?”
Evidenziazione (giallo) - Drafting the Stanford Commencement Address &gt; Posizione 1958</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>“If today was the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And when the answer has been “NO” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something in my life.
Evidenziazione (giallo) - Drafting the Stanford Commencement Address &gt; Posizione 1960</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>Another way to think about this is that your life is a story. It’s hard to see it that way when you’re looking forward at 22. But imagine yourself as an old person looking back on your life. Your life will be a story. It will be your story, with its highs and lows, its heros and villains, its forks in the road that mean everything. And if you can remember that your life is a story in the making, it will help you make those important decisions.

Evidenziazione (giallo) - Email from Steve to Himself &gt; Posizione 2359</p><p style="text-align:center;">---</p><p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds. I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate. I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with. I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. Sent from my iPad
